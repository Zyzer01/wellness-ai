# Malaria: Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/health-topics/malaria) is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through the bites of infected female [Anopheles mosquitoes](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/index.html). It is both preventable and curable.

## Overview

`Malaria` is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical countries. Without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, uncomplicated cases can progress to severe forms, often fatal without intervention.

## Transmission

Malaria is not contagious between individuals. The disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Among the five parasite species causing malaria in humans, [Plasmodium falciparum](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria) and [Plasmodium vivax](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria) pose the greatest threat.

## Risk Factors

Risk of infection varies by location, influenced by factors such as local mosquito types, season, and geography. Approximately half of the world's population is at risk, with an estimated [247 million cases in 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria).

## Vulnerable Groups

Certain populations, including infants, children under 5, pregnant women, and those with HIV/AIDS, are more susceptible to severe malaria. Other vulnerable groups include individuals entering high-transmission areas without immunity.

## Symptoms and Diagnosis

Initial symptoms appear 10-15 days post-bite and include fever, headache, and chills. WHO recommends prompt diagnosis, as untreated [Plasmodium falciparum](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria) can lead to severe illness.

## Testing

Malaria diagnosis involves microscopic blood smear examination or rapid diagnostic tests. Accurate diagnosis aids in distinguishing malaria from other febrile illnesses.

## Treatment

Malaria is treatable, with [Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)](https://www.who.int/malaria/areas/treatment/ACTs/en/) being the most effective. ACTs combine artemisinin derivatives with a partner drug to reduce and eliminate parasites.

## Resistance

Concerns arise over parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines, particularly in the Greater Mekong subregion and Africa. However, artemisinin-resistant parasites are still effectively treated with ACTs.

## Prevention

1. Vector Control: Insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are effective vector control methods.

2. Chemopreventive Therapies: Some antimalarial medicines can prevent malaria, including intermittent preventive treatment, seasonal chemoprevention, and post-discharge chemoprevention.

## Conclusion

Malaria is preventable through comprehensive strategies, including vector control and chemopreventive therapies. Regular monitoring and adherence to WHO recommendations are crucial in the ongoing fight against malaria.
